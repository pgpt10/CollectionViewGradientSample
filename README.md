# Selectively Add & Remove Gradient — UICollectionViewCell

Playing with Collection Views is so much fun and challenging. One of the things I came across is using gradients with collection views.

Adding gradient to a `UICollectionView` or `UICollectionViewCell` is as simple as adding it to any other view. We had a detailed discussion over it in the previous article.

Another challenge is, what if we need to add gradient to a `UICollectionViewCell` on selection and remove it when the `UICollectionViewCell` is de-selected.

## Pre-requisites
Before we start coding, let’s see what we already have 🧐 and how can we use that to solve our problem statement.

<b>Adding gradient to a view</b> — In <a href="https://hackernoon.com/color-it-with-gradients-ios-a4b374c3c79f">this</a> article we had a detailed discussion on how to get that working.

<b>Changing the `UICollectionViewCell’s` properties based on its selection state</b> — <a href="https://hackernoon.com/uicollectionviewcell-selection-made-easy-41dae148379d">Here</a> we have already discussed how <b><i>isSelected</i></b> handles that.

Combining the above 2, now we’re left with <b>“adding the gradient to cell when it is selected and removing it when it is de-selected”</b>. We’re already halfway there, just need to put our knowledge in the right place. 🎯

## What's in the Project
The project includes all the implementation details of how you can handle UICollectionViewCell selection with gradient.
